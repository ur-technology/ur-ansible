# What is that
# ============
#
# This script will help you setting up your digital ocean
# infrastructure with Ansible v2.0+ and DO API v2
#
# Usually, when working with DO, one is supposed to use digital_ocean.py
# inventory file, and spin up instances in a playbook.
# However, this approach is very inconvenient for several reasons:
# - it is veeeery slow
# - your droplets won't have "ansible" names, just IPs
# - ... consequently, putting them into groups is a pain (but doable)
# - but if you succeed doing so, groups will only be available at run time
# - you are required to have 'localhost' in your inventory, which basically ruins 'all' group purpose
# - etc...
# All in all, it is barely usable.
#
# This script attempts to make things easier. It works the following way:
#
# - it will read 'hosts' file in an inventory directory (passed as the first argument)
# - it will spin up a DO droplet for each of these hosts (in parallel !) using ansible
# (note that you can specify image type, droplet size, etc... in the inventory itself)
# - it will generate an complementary inventory file (in the inventory
# directory) containing droplets names along with their IP addresses, so you
# won't need hitting the DO API anymore when running ansible.

# Using this script, you can work like you use to do with bare metal machines,
# without the chicken and egg problem of network configuration)
# The script itself can:
# - spin up droplets (`do_boot2.sh inventory_directory_path`)
# - destroy droplets (`do_boot2.sh inventory_directory_path deleted`) 

# Since the droplets are created in parallel, you will also save tons of time
# when building an infrastructure involving a bunch of droplets. As an example,
# creating 8 droplets takes 130 seconds using this script, almost 570 using a
# "classic approach". Destroying them takes 10 secs with this script, 55 using
# a classic approach. So in the end, you get a 5 fold speed up, and a much
# better usability. Of course, the more droplets, the more gain.
#
# DO_API_TOKEN environment variable must be set.
#
# Change defaults below
# ---------------------

# Digital Ocean default values
# You can override them using do_something in your inventory file
# Example:
# 
# [www]
# www1 do_size_slug="1gb" do_region_slug="nyc1" do_image=12345
# ...
#
# If you don't override in your inventory, the defaults below will apply
DEFAULT_SIZE="512mb" # 512mb (override with do_size_slug)
DEFAULT_REGION="ams2" # ams2 (override with do_region_slug)
DEFAULT_IMAGE="ubuntu-14-10-x64" # Ubuntu 14.10 x64 (override with do_image_slug)
DEFAULT_KEY=785648 # SSH key, change this ! (override with do_key)

# localhost entry for temporary inventory
# This is a temp inventory generated to start the DO droplets
# You might want to change ansible_python_interpreter
LOCALHOST_ENTRY="localhost ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python2" 

# Set state to present by default
STATE=${2:-"present"}

# digital_ocean module command to use
# name, size, region, image and key will be filled automatically
COMMAND="state=$STATE command=droplet private_networking=yes unique_name=yes"
